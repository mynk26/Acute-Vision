# Acute-Vision
I build a REST API for my college project named 'Acute-Vision'. This project is a whole integrated system of marking attendance with face recognition and a web application for accessing and modify the data , it has Two types of user First is student who can only check his/her attendance and on the other hand the second user i.e. teacher which is granted to some administrative permissions with the help of which he can change and manage data. This repository contains the API as well as a working website with basic html pages to understand of the website which ultimately helps in developing front-end. All the urls for the api are uploaded in a file named:'urls.pdf' also I add a requirement.txt file to get this work in your hands with very few efforts.
